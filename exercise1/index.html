<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone, <br> I am <b>Akuto Konou</b>, from Togo (West Africa), architect and urban planner. I am currently Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of CRP at ISU. I am passionate about research in sustainable development, entrepreneurship and green technologies. But I will leaving Ames to start soon a PhD in Switzerland, on Urban Agriculture and Health in Africa cities.

I do not have much experience in HTML & JavaScript. I just read some materials about them. For coding in general, I only took the GIS automation and programming class the next semester (CRP 556) where I learned a bit of Python language. According to GIS, I am taking the GIS certificate, and I also completed the CRP 551.

From this class, I want to learn how to create interactive platforms, to help decision-makers in gathering data and planning a better way. I believe that this method can help a lot especially in developing countries communities. <br> Thank you.</p>
